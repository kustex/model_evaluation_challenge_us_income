# Model Evaluation Challenge Us Income

This little project was a challenge during the BeCode AI Data Operator Course I did. During this 2-day project I had to analyze US income data. I had to predict if people belonged to a certain category. We had to use a RandomForestClassifier.

### Must-have features
Baseline accuracy  
Multiple evaluation metrics  
Hyper parameter tuning  
Some time of validation strategy  

### To Do 
At this moment I reached the must-have features. To make the model better I can try to select other models. Some better visualization of the hyperparameter tuning should also be added.
